In Higurashi no Naku Koro ni games, each chapter begins with a mysterious poem written by a person named "Frederica Bernkastel".
Her poems summarize the theme of each chapter and these reveal some of what is going to happen in the following arc.
The poem itself is quite meaningful as you play through each chapter.
<br> Frederica Bernkastel possibly stems from Rika's culminated personality after the repeated worlds, as reflected by Rika's sudden persona switch from an eleven-year-old's personality to that of the 110-year-old.
 It's likely that Frederica is the side of Rika that has experienced all of the worlds that Rika was forced to live through, then separated when she lost interest in survival and only cared about moving on to 'the next world'.</p> <br>
